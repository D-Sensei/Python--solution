Problem
Given an array arr[ ] of N positive integers, the task is to find the greatest
element on the left of every element in the array which is strictly smaller
than itself, if this element does not exist for an index print "-1 ".
Example 1:
Input:
arr[]
Output:
-1 234 -I

Solution
a=int(input("N -"))
n=list(map(int, input("elements of array-").strip().split()))
b = [-1 if x == min(n) else -1 if x == max(n) else x for x in n]
print(b)
